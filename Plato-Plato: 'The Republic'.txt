{"title":"Plato: 'The Republic'","authors":["Plato"],"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publishedDate":"2000-09-25","description":"First published in 2000, this translation of one of the great works of Western political thought is based on the assumption that when Plato chose the dialogue form for his writing, he intended these dialogues to sound like conversations - although conversations of a philosophical sort. In addition to a vivid, dignified and accurate rendition of Plato's text, the student and general reader will find many aids to comprehension in this volume: an introduction that assesses the cultural background to the Republic, its place within political philosophy, and its general argument; succinct notes in the body of the text; an analytical summary of the work's content; a full glossary of proper names; a chronology of important events; and a guide to further reading. The result is an accomplished and accessible edition of this seminal work, suitable for philosophers and classicists as well as historians of political thought at all levels.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"052148443X"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780521484435"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":444,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Philosophy"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":6,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.3.4.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aPwPjVIxbGQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aPwPjVIxbGQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aPwPjVIxbGQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Republic+inauthor:Plato&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aPwPjVIxbGQC&dq=The+Republic+inauthor:Plato&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Plato_The_Republic.html?hl=&id=aPwPjVIxbGQC"}
